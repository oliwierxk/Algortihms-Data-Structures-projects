Write an integer calculator. Use the postfix notation to handle precedence of operators, functions and parentheses.

Each formula is a valid expression in an infix notation with functions and ends with a dot ('.'). Each token is separated by some whitespace characters. Each operand is a positive integer (although the result of an operation might be negative). Each operator is a single character and every function name consists only of capital letters.
The following operations are available, in the ascending order of priority:

a + b, a - b ;
a * b, a / b -all operations are made on integers, hence the results of division are rounded down (standard C '/' operator). You cannot divide by 0 (see the Output section);
IF(a, b, c) -if a>0 return b, otherwise c,
N a -unary negation, i.e. -a,
MIN( a1, a2, ... ), MAX(a1, a2, ...) -functions MIN and MAX do not have a restriction on the number of parameters;
( ... ) -parentheses.
